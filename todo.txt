Into Firebase:
- How to retrieve (or save) images with associated metadata ?
- How to get new uploaded images (for e.g. since a timestamp) ?
- How to move folders into sub-folders (either programmatically or from web interface) ?
- (ultimately) How to generate a shorter upload ID ?

V2:
- we should give users the option to enter their email address when they upload the pictures.
  That way, we can send them a confirmation email with the Upload IDs.
  - It is a better way for them to save the upload IDs
  - With the current design, they have take a screenshot or manually write it down.
